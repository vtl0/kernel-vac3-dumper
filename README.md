## Kernel vac3_dumper

Stealthy linux VAC3 module dumper, designed to be **version-agnostic** (future-proof) and **extremely hard to detect**.

##### Features:
- No writing of steam or game memory
- ptrace-less memory read (no TracerPID)
- Memory footprinting for version-agnostic identification of VAC3 loading routine

Special thanks to h33p for his vaclog which was used as reference for this project
